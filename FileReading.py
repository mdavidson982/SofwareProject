#This class reads the RUN file and creates a dataframe that consist of all the students.


#THIS IS A PYTHON OBJECT CLASS: The comments within the openFile function explains how the selected RUN file returns
                                #a DataFrame about all the information for each student.




#Here is how the object functions:
#First, create the class. Similar to Java, the class holds everything relavent to the object
class FileReading:
  #This is the constructor. A FileReading Object requires only 1 input (self is similar to how 'this' functioins in Java)
  #input: runFile, runFile is the name of the RUN file you're looking to run.
  def __init__(self,runFile):
    #self.runFile is basically saying this.runFile in Java.
    self.runFile = runFile
    #this is the dataFrame that will be returned in the openFile function
    #Its an empty dataframe that has 6 columns. 
    self.sectionData = pd.DataFrame(columns=["Group","Section","First Name","Last Name","Student ID", "Grade"])

  
  #openFile function uses the runFile provided in the constuctor.
  #RETURNS A DATAFRAME OR A TUPLE
  #The DataFrame is what you're looking for. This contains the data of all the students
  #If a file was not found, then it will return a tuple consisting of the error and the File Name that wasn't found.
  def openFile(self):
    try:
      with open(self.runFile, 'r') as main:

    #Dataframe represents all of the information of every student included in the RUN file. This will be the dataframe used throughout the project for data analysis.
    #The dataframe is structured with 6 columns. Listed below.
